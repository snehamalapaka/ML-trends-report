# Machine Learning Trends Report  
**Date:** May 23, 2025  

---

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes the latest trends in machine learning based on two key sources:

- **Arxiv preprints**: Recent research papers in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML)  
- **GitHub trending repositories**: Popular open-source projects focused on ML  

The goal is to identify notable new techniques, models, tools, and patterns in research and community interest.

## 2. Key Findings from Arxiv

- **Top trending topics** include:  
  - Large Language Models (LLMs)  
  - Reinforcement Learning  
  - Diffusion Models  
  - Multi-modal Learning  
  - Reasoning Capabilities in models  

- Emerging research focuses on improving reasoning in visual generation, advanced language understanding, and scalable multi-task learning.

## 3. Key Findings from GitHub

- Popular repositories reflect community interest in:  
  - Transformer-based models and libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers)  
  - Diffusion model implementations for image and audio generation  
  - Tools for LLM pipelines and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
  - AI applications in quantitative finance (e.g., Microsoft’s Qlib)  
  - ChatGPT prompt engineering and curation  

- High star counts (tens of thousands) indicate strong adoption and active developer engagement.
