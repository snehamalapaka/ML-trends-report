# ML Trends Report

## Overview

This project scrapes and analyzes the latest trends in machine learning from sources like Arxiv and GitHub trending repositories. It generates a summary report highlighting notable new techniques, models, and tools, as well as patterns in community interest and emerging research directions.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`  
  Contains Python scripts for scraping data and analyzing trends:
  - `arxiv_scraper.py`: Scrapes recent machine learning papers from Arxiv.
  - `github_trending_scraper.py`: Scrapes trending ML repositories from GitHub.
  - `analyze_arxiv.py`: Analyzes scraped Arxiv data for keyword trends.

- `data/`  
  Stores CSV files generated by the scrapers:
  - `arxiv_papers.csv`
  - `github_trending_ml.csv`

- `summary_report.md`  
  Markdown report summarizing key findings from the data.

- `summary_report.pdf`  
  PDF version of the summary report.

## How to Run

1. Set up a Python environment with required packages (e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`).
2. Run the scrapers to collect fresh data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/arxiv_scraper.py
   python scripts/github_trending_scraper.py
